# Simple-Play-Generator_NLP

* I am going to create a model which can predict a play using RNNs
* I will show an example on what kind of things we need to do to create the model, so that it can write a version of it's own
* The model will be a charcter predictive model that can, when provided a sequence of characters give the next character.
* Output from the last prediction can be given as an input to the new prediction.
